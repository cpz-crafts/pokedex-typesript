# Pokédex Challenge
This is my submissiong to the Arkus AI frontend developer challenge.

You can see the live version here: [Live Pokédex]()

## Installation and running
To install and run the app please clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cpz-crafts/pokedex-typesript
cd pokedex-typescript
npm install
npm run start
```

## Implementation Notes
I've created the small Pokédex with TypeScript and React by fetching data via the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It also contains pagination with React Hooks (useState and useEffect). Additionally the styling of the app was done using [MUI](https://mui.com/).
